I would like to thank Dr. Adam Belloum and Dr. Ben van Werkhoven for introducing me to the project topic and ensuring its finalisation. I would especially like to thank Dr. Belloum for his constant guidance and advice throughout the course of the thesis. Further, I would like to thank Dr. Roel Aaij, Dr. Ronald Bruin and Brían Ó Fearraigh from Nikhef for assisting with the Physics-based technicalities of the topic. Also, I would like to acknowledge Dr. Aaij's assistance with accessing the Viltstift AMD GPUs, that allowed for rapid experimentation. Finally, I would like to thank my co-worker Arumoy Shome for the exchange of ideas and discussions that enriched the thesis.
