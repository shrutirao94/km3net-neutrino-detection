    "1. Compute normals for each timeslice group: \n",
    "Normals are oriented  with respect to the input point cloud if normals exist. Next, converts float64 numpy array of shape (n, 3) to Open3D format. Normals are required to generate meshes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Generate Poission Mesh: (See Screened Poission Reconstruction for more information below)\n",
    "Implements the Screened Poisson Reconstruction proposed in Kazhdan and Hoppe, \"Screened Poisson Surface Reconstruction\", 2013. See https://github.com/mkazhdan/PoissonRecon\n",

    "#### Screened Poisson Reconstruction\n",
    "It uses an approach known as an implicit meshing method, which is trying to “envelop” the data in a smooth cloth. We try to fit a watertight surface from the original point set by creating an entirely new point set representing an isosurface linked to the normals. There are several parameters available that affect the result of the meshing:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Depth:\n",
    "Tree-depth is used for the reconstruction. The higher, the more detailed the mesh. With noisy data you keep vertices in the generated mesh that are outliers but the algorithm doesn’t detect them as such. So a low value (maybe between 5 and 7) provides a smoothing effect, but you will lose detail. The higher the depth-value the higher is the resulting amount of vertices of the generated mesh.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Width: \n",
    "This specifies the target width of the finest level of the tree structure, which is called an octree. D\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Scale:\n",
    "It describes the ratio between the diameter of the cube used for reconstruction and the diameter of the samples’ bounding cube. Very abstract, the default parameter usually works well.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Fit:\n",
    "The linear_fit parameter if set to true, let the reconstructor use linear interpolation to estimate the positions of iso-vertices."
