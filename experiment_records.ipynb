    "**Can Pointnet neural networks be used to identify timeslices with neutrino events?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, it can be used, after several modifications (see PointNet Architecture below)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Can it perform with sufficient accuracy, and recall?**\n",
    "\n",
    "As of now, it does not meet the industry requirements. However, since there is no such previous work, \n",
    "the results of this thesis will set a benchmark for how well pointnet can perform\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Addition of timeslice groups [Relevant Notebooks](./data_generation/)\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is divided into timeslice groups based on time chunks of 150000 nanoseconds. Each timeslice group contains xyz and time values, aside from other metadata. This will allow the network will identify if the timeslice contains neutrino hits or not. \n",

    "Separate timeslice groups into two classes:\n",
    "    1. `Class 0` groups that have only noise points\n",
    "    2. `Class 1` groups that have both noise and hits (referenced as mixed groups)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For each class, separate into train and test groups\n",
    "Groups are further split into train and test groups\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Groups identified as test groups are directly saved\n",
    "This is because test data must not be tocuhed and manipulated in any way\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Groups identified as training groups are further sampled\n",
    "There is severe class imbalance within groups in `Class 1` that contains both hits and noise points. This can severely impact training performance. For this, the data is further sampled.\n",

    "1. Compute normals for each timeslice group: \n",
    "Normals are oriented  with respect to the input point cloud if normals exist. Next, converts float64 numpy array of shape (n, 3) to Open3D format. Normals are required to generate meshes.\n",

    "    \n",
    "#### Screened Poisson Reconstruction\n",
    "It uses an approach known as an implicit meshing method, which is trying to “envelop” the data in a smooth cloth. We try to fit a watertight surface from the original point set by creating an entirely new point set representing an isosurface linked to the normals. There are several parameters available that affect the result of the meshing:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Depth:\n",
    "Tree-depth is used for the reconstruction. The higher, the more detailed the mesh. With noisy data you keep vertices in the generated mesh that are outliers but the algorithm doesn’t detect them as such. So a low value (maybe between 5 and 7) provides a smoothing effect, but you will lose detail. The higher the depth-value the higher is the resulting amount of vertices of the generated mesh.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Width: \n",
    "This specifies the target width of the finest level of the tree structure, which is called an octree. D\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Scale:\n",
    "It describes the ratio between the diameter of the cube used for reconstruction and the diameter of the samples’ bounding cube. Very abstract, the default parameter usually works well.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Fit:\n",
    "The linear_fit parameter if set to true, let the reconstructor use linear interpolation to estimate the positions of iso-vertices.\n",

    "# PointNet Architecture \n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements for point cloud data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Point clouds should be unordered. Algorithm has to be invariant to permutations of the input set.\n",
    "2. Network must be invariant to rigid transformations.\n",
    "3. Network should capture interactions among points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following are the modifications made to PointNet to work with KM3Net Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Mapping `.off files`\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of .off files that contain meshes represented by vertices and triangular faces. Vertices are points in a 3D space and each triangle is formed by 3 vertex indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Point sampling (As per https://github.com/fxia22/pointnet.pytorch)\n",
    "\n",
    "As points are not uniformly distributed across object’s surface, it will be difficult for  PointNet to classify them. \n",
    "Points are therefore uniformly sampled on the object’s surface. Faces can have different areas and hence we may assign probability of choosing a particular face proportionally to its area. \n",
    "As the network will have dense layers in the architecture, a fixed number of points are required per point cloud. For this, faces are sampled from the constructed distribution. After that, one point per chosen face gets sampled.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Augmentations\n",
    "That pointclouds can have different sizes and can be placed in different parts of the coordinate system.\n",
    "So, they are translated to the origin by subtracting mean from all its points and normalizing its points into a unit sphere. To augment the data during training, we randomly rotate objects around Z-axis and add Gaussian noise as described in the original paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Model\n",
    "The key point is that the result should be invariant to input points permutations and geometric transformations, such as rigid transformations.\n",
    "    1. First tensors will have size (batch_size, num_of_points, 3). In this case MLP with shared weights is just 1-dim convolution with a kernel of size 1.\n",
    "    2. To ensure invariance to transformations, apply the 3x3 transformation matrix predicted by T-Net to coordinates of input points. It is not possible to encode translations in 3D space by a 3-dimensional matrix. This is therefore taken care of by translating point clouds to the origin during pre-processing.\n",
    "    3. For initialisation of the output matrix, it should be an identity matrix by default to start training with no transformations at all. So, an identity matrix is added to the output. Additionally, the same but 64-dim T-Net is used to align extracted point features after applying MLP.\n",
    "    4. To provide permutation invariance, a symmetric function (max pooling) is applyed to the extracted and transformed features so the result does not depend on the order of input points anymore.\n",
    "    5. Loss is chosen to be NLLoss() with Log Sigmoid activation function (based on experiments mentioned below)"

If using a hinge loss does result in better performance on a given binary classification problem, is likely that a squared hinge loss may be appropriate. As with using the hinge loss function, the target variable must be modified to have values in the set {-1, 1}."
